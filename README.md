## Hi there!

I am a web developer full stack and biological anthropologist.

When I discovered programming, I was passionate about it and I took on the task of bringing social sciences to a web environment, because I believe that social changes can be generated by combining both disciplines. 

I work with HTML, CSS, JS, NodeJS, React, MongoDB, mongoose, handelbars. But I'm always in the process of learning new things to become a better developer.
