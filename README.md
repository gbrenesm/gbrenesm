# Hi there! 😎

## I am a full stack web developer and biological anthropologist 💀.

When I discovered programming, I was passionate about it and I took on the task of bringing social sciences to a web environment, because I believe that social changes can be generated by combining both disciplines. 

- 🔭 I work with HTML, CSS, JS, NodeJS, React, MongoDB, mongoose. But I'm always in the process of learning new things to become a better developer.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Next.js and GraphQL.

- 🌞 Fun fact: I also love literature 📚 and I have a beatiful pit bull 🐕.
